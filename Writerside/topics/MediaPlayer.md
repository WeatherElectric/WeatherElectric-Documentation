# MediaPlayer

MP3 Player that reads the file's metadata

* [Installation](MediaPlayer-Installation.md)
* [Custom Audio Setup](MediaPlayer-Custom-Audio.md)
* [TagLib Wrapper](MediaPlayer-TagLib-Wrapper.md)

# IMPORTANT!
* DEPENDING ON HOW MANY MP3 FILES YOU PUT IN THE FOLDER, THE GAME MAY TAKE LONGER TO START UP!
* THIS IS INEVITABLE! PUTTING IT ON ANOTHER THREAD CRASHES THE GAME, AND IF IT WERE ASYNC IT MAY NOT BE FULLY LOADED BY THE TIME YOU SPAWN ONE IN, CAUSING PROBLEMS!
