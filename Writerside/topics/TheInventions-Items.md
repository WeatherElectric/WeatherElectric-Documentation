# Items

## Black Hole (Sun)

    A triggerable black hole. Sucks things in them removes them!
    Also has a bigger variant!

## Voidball

    Deletes anything it touches, but way smaller than the black hole and doesn't suck nearby objects in.

## The Freezinator

    Freezes any object in the scene. Who needs physics anyways?

## GE-64

    The explosive from Just Cause 3, stick it to some poor guy and explod!

## Timescale Keeper

    Adjust the timescale of the game to any value, it just can't be negative and it can't be 0. Well, it can be 0, but you'll be softlocked, so it prevents itself from being 0.

## VoidCounter Pan/Shield

    A frying pan and a shield that deflect the projectiles of corrupted nulls/null agents!
