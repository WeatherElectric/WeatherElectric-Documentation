# Recommended Setups

## A Good WaterZone

Set up [SwimmingController](TheLibraryElectric-Water.md#swimmingcontroller), [WaterZone](TheLibraryElectric-Water.md#waterzone), [DrowningManager](TheLibraryElectric-Water.md#drowningmanager), and [SpawnOnTriggerEnter](TheLibraryElectric-Misc.md#spawnontriggerenter) all at once.
Use the recommended values, or mess with them to get it how you want.
Put this prefab as the thing that SpawnOnTriggerEnter spawns: [splash.unitypackage](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1145870022749737030/1151030420784300112/splashj.unitypackage)
